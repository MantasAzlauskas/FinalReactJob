# Introduction

ENGINEHOUSE is a project that features a website with engines and spare parts for various models. Users can view the specifications of each engine. If a customer cannot find the required engine or part, they can contact us and describe what they need. Additionally, there is an admin server side of the project, which requires login credentials to access. This section contains all information about customers and their needs. I developed this project as my final exam.
